# Problem: 
* Often, local weather stations cannot report accurate forecasts relative to your specific location.

* However, many weather stations have public repositories of historical weather statistics, which may be closer to your specific location.

# Solution: 
* Utilizing publicly available weather datasets (ie National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to provide accurate machine learning location-based weather forecasts.

# Future Works:
* Ideally, I'd like to be able to predict accurately more than one day in advance.

* Auto update max_temp, min_temp and precip values using APIs
